# Contributing Guideline
Welcome contributing to Fast Pipeline in Github Actions!

Contributing to this repository is not limited to writing the code or submitting the PR. We will also appreciate if you can file issues, provide feedback and suggest new features. Bug, of course, contributing the code is more than welcome. 

To make things simpler, if you're fixing a small issue (e.g. typo), go ahead submitting a PR and we will pick it up; but if you're planning to submit a bigger PR to implement a new feature, it's easier to submit a new issue to discuss the design with the maintainers first before implementing it.

Happy contributing!
